/**
 * Main class for ADFGVX cipher showcase.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * In cryptography, the ADFGVX cipher was a field cipher used by the German Army
 * on the Western Front during World War I. ADFGVX was in fact an extension of an earlier cipher called ADFGX.
 * Invented by Lieutenant[1] Fritz Nebel (1891â€“1977)[2] and introduced in March 1918,
 * the cipher was a fractionating transposition cipher which combined a modified Polybius square
 * with a single columnar transposition.
 * <p>
 * The cipher is named after the six possible letters used in the ciphertext: A, D, F, G, V and X.
 * Letters were chosen deliberately because they are very different from one another in the Morse code.
 * That reduced the possibility of operator error.
 * <p>
 * Nebel designed the cipher to provide an army on the move with encryption that
 * was more convenient than trench codes but was still secure.
 * <p>
 * In fact, the German believed the ADFGVX cipher was unbreakable
